> **Comprehensive statistical analysis of credit risk factors using advanced statistical methods to support data-driven lending decisions in banking operations.**

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates **advanced statistical competency** essential for Data Analyst roles in the finance industry. Through rigorous statistical analysis of credit risk factors, it provides actionable insights for banking institutions to minimize default rates and optimize lending strategies.

##  Business Problem

**Challenge**: Financial institutions need robust statistical frameworks to assess credit risk, minimize loan defaults, and make data-driven lending decisions.

**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive statistical analysis framework that:
- Identifies key risk factors through advanced statistical testing
- Quantifies relationships between variables and default probability  
- Creates predictive models for risk assessment
- Provides actionable business recommendations backed by statistical evidence

## üìà Statistical Methods Applied

### 1. **Data Quality Assessment & Preprocessing**
- Missing value analysis and treatment with robust error handling
- Outlier detection using IQR method for statistical validity
- Comprehensive data cleaning framework
- Feature preparation for statistical modeling

### 2. **Descriptive Statistics Analysis**
- Central tendency measures (mean, median, mode)
- Variability assessment (standard deviation, variance, CV)
- Distribution analysis (skewness, kurtosis, normality testing)
- Advanced descriptive measures for business insights

### 3. **Inferential Statistics & Hypothesis Testing**
- Two-sample t-tests for numerical variable comparisons
- Chi-square independence tests for categorical associations
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d, Cram√©r's V)
- Statistical significance testing with proper interpretation

### 4. **Correlation Analysis**
- Pearson correlation for linear relationships
- Spearman correlation for non-parametric analysis
- Statistical significance testing of correlations
- Comprehensive correlation matrix with business interpretation

### 5. **Predictive Modeling**
- Logistic regression with statistical validation
- Model performance evaluation (ROC-AUC, confusion matrix)
- Feature importance analysis with statistical interpretation
- Business model validation and insights

##  Key Statistical Findings

| Statistical Analysis | Key Finding | Statistical Significance | Business Impact |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Interest Rate Analysis** | Strong positive correlation with defaults | r=0.534, p<0.001 | Primary risk factor |
| **Income Analysis** | Significant difference between groups | t-test p<0.001 | Critical underwriting factor |
| **Loan Grade Analysis** | Strong association with defaults | œá¬≤ test p<0.001 | Risk segmentation validation |
| **Predictive Model** | Significant predictive power | ROC-AUC > 0.75 | Operational deployment ready |

##  Business Impact & Recommendations

### **Strategic Insights**
1. **Interest Rate Risk**: Primary driver of default probability
2. **Income Verification**: Critical factor in risk assessment
3. **Loan Grade Classification**: Statistically validated risk segmentation
4. **Employment Stability**: Key predictor for loan performance

### **Actionable Recommendations**
1. **Enhanced Risk-Based Pricing**: Implement statistical models for interest rate optimization
2. **Improved Underwriting**: Prioritize income verification and employment history
3. **Portfolio Management**: Monitor high-risk segments using statistical thresholds
4. **Automated Screening**: Deploy predictive models for loan approval processes

### **Estimated Business Value**
- **15-25% reduction** in default rates through statistical insights
- **Enhanced profitability** via optimized risk-based pricing
- **Improved decision accuracy** through data-driven frameworks
- **Regulatory compliance** with statistical documentation
