DATA DICTIONARY SUMMARY
========================

This dataset contains information about borrowers and their credit profiles, used to assess credit risk and predict loan defaults.

Key Variables:

1. person_age: Age of the borrower (numeric)
   - Range: 18-100+ years
   - Used to assess life stage and risk profile

2. person_income: Annual income of the borrower (numeric)
   - Currency: USD
   - Key indicator of repayment capacity

3. person_home_ownership: Home ownership status (categorical)
   - Values: RENT, OWN, MORTGAGE, OTHER
   - Indicates financial stability

4. person_emp_length: Employment length in years (numeric)
   - Indicator of job stability
   - Correlated with income reliability

5. loan_intent: Purpose of the loan (categorical)
   - Values: PERSONAL, EDUCATION, MEDICAL, VENTURE, HOMEIMPROVEMENT, DEBTCONSOLIDATION
   - Different intents carry different risk levels

6. loan_grade: Credit grade assigned to the loan (categorical)
   - Values: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
   - A = Lowest risk, G = Highest risk

7. loan_amnt: Loan amount requested (numeric)
   - Currency: USD
   - Higher amounts typically indicate higher risk

8. loan_int_rate: Interest rate on the loan (numeric)
   - Percentage value
   - Reflects lender's risk assessment

9. loan_percent_income: Loan amount as percentage of income (numeric)
   - Key debt-to-income indicator
   - Higher values indicate higher default risk

10. cb_person_default_on_file: Historical default (categorical)
