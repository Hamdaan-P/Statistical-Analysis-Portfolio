##  Statistical Framework

### 1. Descriptive Statistics Analysis

#### Central Tendency Measures
Mean (μ̂): Arithmetic average of the dataset
Median: Middle value when data is ordered
Mode: Most frequently occurring value (for discrete variables)

Business Application:

Mean revenue for performance benchmarking

Median for robust central tendency (outlier-resistant)

Mode for identifying common transaction patterns

#### Measures of Variability
Standard Deviation (σ̂): √[Σ(xi - μ̂)²/(n-1)]
Variance (σ̂²): Average of squared deviations from mean
Range: Maximum - Minimum value
Interquartile Range (IQR): Q3 - Q1

Coefficient of Variation: (σ̂/μ̂) × 100%

Interpretation: <15% (low), 15-35% (moderate), >35% (high variability)

#### Distribution Characteristics
Skewness: Measure of asymmetry

Positive (>0.5): Right-skewed distribution

Negative (<-0.5): Left-skewed distribution

Symmetric (-0.5 to 0.5): Approximately normal

Kurtosis: Measure of tail heaviness

Positive: Heavy-tailed (more extreme values)

Negative: Light-tailed (fewer extreme values)

### 2. Correlation Analysis

#### Pearson Correlation Coefficient
r = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)²Σ(yi - ȳ)²]

Interpretation Guidelines:

|r| ≥ 0.7: Strong correlation

0.3 ≤ |r| < 0.7: Moderate correlation

0.1 ≤ |r| < 0.3: Weak correlation

|r| < 0.1: Negligible correlation

text

#### Statistical Significance Testing
H₀: ρ = 0 (no linear correlation in population)
H₁: ρ ≠ 0 (linear correlation exists in population)

Test Statistic: t = r√[(n-2)/(1-r²)]
Degrees of Freedom: df = n - 2
Critical Value: t_α/2,df at α = 0.05

text

#### Confidence Intervals for Correlations
Fisher's z-transformation:
z = 0.5 × ln[(1+r)/(1-r)]

Standard Error: SE_z = 1/√(n-3)

95% CI in z-space: z ± 1.96 × SE_z
Transform back to r-space using inverse transformation

text

### 3. Inferential Statistics

#### Confidence Intervals for Means
For population mean (μ):
x̄ ± t_α/2,df × (s/√n)

Where:

x̄ = sample mean

t_α/2,df = critical t-value

s = sample standard deviation

n = sample size

df = n - 1

text

#### One-Sample t-Tests
Purpose: Test if population mean equals hypothesized value

H₀: μ = μ₀ (population mean equals benchmark)
H₁: μ ≠ μ₀ (population mean differs from benchmark)

Test Statistic: t = (x̄ - μ₀)/(s/√n)
Degrees of Freedom: df = n - 1
Decision Rule: Reject H₀ if |t| > t_α/2,df or p-value < α

text

**Business Applications**:
- Revenue performance vs industry benchmarks
- Profit margins vs company targets
- Performance metrics vs strategic goals

#### Two-Sample Independent t-Tests
Purpose: Compare means between two independent groups

H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (equal population means)
H₁: μ₁ ≠ μ₂ (unequal population means)

Equal Variances: t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂)/sp√(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)
Unequal Variances: t = (x̄₁ - x̄₂)/√(s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂)

Where sp = √[((n₁-1)s₁² + (n₂-1)s₂²)/(n₁+n₂-2)]

**Assumption Testing**:
- **Levene's Test**: Tests equality of variances
- **Normality**: Shapiro-Wilk test (for n < 5000)
- **Independence**: Assumed based on business context

### 4. Effect Size Analysis

#### Cohen's d for Two-Group Comparisons
d = (μ₁ - μ₂)/σpooled

Interpretation:

|d| < 0.2: Small effect

0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5: Medium effect

|d| ≥ 0.5: Large effect

Practical Significance:

Small effects may still be business-relevant with large samples

Large effects indicate practically important differences

##  Statistical Assumptions and Limitations

### Key Assumptions

#### 1. Independence
- **Assumption**: Sales transactions are independent events
- **Validation**: Different customers, dates, and geographic locations
- **Business Context**: B2B sales with diverse customer base supports independence

#### 2. Random Sampling  
- **Assumption**: Sample represents broader population of similar businesses
- **Limitation**: Kaggle dataset may have selection bias
- **Mitigation**: Large sample size and geographic diversity enhance representativeness

#### 3. Measurement Scale
- **Requirements**: Ratio scale for financial metrics (revenue, profit, costs)
- **Validation**: All financial variables meet ratio scale requirements
- **Business Relevance**: Enables meaningful statistical operations

### Statistical Limitations

#### Sample Size Considerations
- **Current**: n = 1,000 (adequate for basic statistical inference)
- **Power**: Sufficient for detecting medium to large effects
- **Generalizability**: Results apply to similar global B2B sales contexts

#### Temporal Validity
- **Data Period**: 2010-2017 (may not reflect current market conditions)
- **Business Cycles**: Multiple years capture various economic conditions
- **Trend Analysis**: Limited by historical nature of data

#### External Validity
- **Population**: Results limited to B2B sales with similar characteristics
- **Market Context**: Global dataset enhances external validity
- **Industry**: Applicable to diverse product categories and regions

##  Quality Assurance and Validation

### Data Quality Checks
Sample validation framework
def validate_dataset(df):
quality_metrics = {
'completeness': 1 - df.isnull().sum().sum() / (df.shape * df.shape),​
'uniqueness': df['Order ID'].nunique() / len(df),
'consistency': len(df[df['Total Revenue'] >= 0]) / len(df),
'accuracy': len(df[df['Total Profit'] <= df['Total Revenue']]) / len(df)
}
return quality_metrics
